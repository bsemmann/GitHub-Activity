    It was a calm day in the forest, the perfect day for me to take a walk through the forest
on my favorite hiking trail. The trail starts of gentle and there is no danger. Their seldom was,
but for some reason there were little to no people walking on the trail this day. Little did I know 
there was a sign that warned of many bears in the area. I kept walking without having this knowledge,
when I had to tie my shoe. So I stoped on the trail, bent over and tied my shoe. When I stood up I was 
Staring down a bear no less then 20 yards down the trail.
