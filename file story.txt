    It was a calm day in the forest, the perfect day for me to take a walk through the forest
on my favorite hiking trail. The trail starts of gentle and there is no danger. Their seldom was,
but for some reason there were little to no people walking on the trail this day. Little did I know 
there was a sign that warned of many bears in the area. I kept walking without having this knowledge,
when I had to tie my shoe. So I stoped on the trail, bent over and tied my shoe. When I stood up I was 
Staring down a bear no less then 20 yards down the trail.

    This was indeed my first rodeo when it came to participating in a human-bear interaction. I quickly
racked my brain to recall any advice I may have heard in the past that would help me exit the situation
relatively unscathed. My fight-flight response was simple- I certainly was not going to initiate
fisticuffs with this large mammal. But I wasn't quite sure about flight either. This thing could
definitely chase me down if it wanted to. I decided to go with a third option instead.

    I had to bet on the hope that the bear didn't have any intention of harming me, because as soon as it
did, I was as good as dead. I tried to walk slowly away from the bear while maintaining eye-contact. The bear 
was coming towards me at a similar pace, and my heartbeat was quickening. The bear came so close to me that I 
was almost able to touch it. Luckliy, it did not show any intention of hurting me. I gently stroked the bear's fur
and it seemed to like it and was in a playful mood. I became calm and started to pet the bear. We had fun for sometime
and when it was almost time for my work, I bid the bear farewell and left the forest. What a day it was!
